Add the remaining 1 cup of butter. Beat on medium until light and fluffy, about 2 to 3 minutes. With the mixer on low, add the egg yolks and almond extract, beating until just combined. Gradually add flour and salt, beating until just combined. Stop occasionally and scrape - down the bowl during mixing. In a large mixing bowl, beat the egg whites with an electric mixer with clean beaters or the whisk attachment on high speed until stiff peaks form, about 5 minutes. Working in - batches, gently fold the egg whites into the cookie batter until combined and no streaks of egg white remain. Divide the batter evenly among 3 bowls.

Spread the remaining 1/4 cup jam in an even thin layer over the plain layer. Place the red layer on top of the jammy - plain layer and remove and discard the parchment. Cover with a sheet of plastic wrap. Place one of the baking pans on top of the stacked layers. Evenly place weights (such as plates or canned vegetables) on top of the pan. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours or up to - 12 hours. Once chilled, remove the weights and plastic wrap. Place a large cutting board on top of the stack and invert. Carefully remove and discard the parchment paper from the green - layer. Using a serrated knife, trim the edges to straighten. Place the stack, green layer up, on a wire rack set inside a large, rimmed baking sheet. In a medium, microwave-safe bowl, heat half of the chocolate chips in 30-second intervals stirring between each, until the chocolate is melted. Spread the melted chocolate over the bottom stack. Let cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Refrigerate, uncovered, until the chocolate is set, about 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 275°F (135°C). Spread bread evenly over 2 rimmed baking sheets. Stagger trays on oven racks and bake until completely dried, about 50 minutes total, rotating trays and stirring bread cubes several times during baking. Remove from oven and allow to cool. Increase oven temperature to 350°F (180°C). In a large Dutch oven, melt butter over medium-high heat until foaming subsides (do not allow butter to brown), about 2 minutes. Add sausage and mash with a stiff whisk or potato masher to break up into fine pieces (largest pieces should be no bigger than 1/4 inch). Cook, stirring frequently, until only a few bits of pink remain, about 8 minutes. Add onion, celery, garlic, and sage and cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables are softened, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and add half of stock. Whisk remaining stock, eggs, and 1 1/2 tsp parsley in a medium bowl until homogeneous. Stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, slowly pour egg mixture into sausage mixture. Add bread cubes and fold gently until evenly mixed. To cook stuffing, transfer to a buttered 10-inch cast iron skillet, cover tightly with aluminum foil, and bake until an instant-read thermometer reads 150°F (66°C) when inserted into center of dish, about 45 minutes. Remove foil and continue baking until golden brown and crisp on top, 15 to 20 minutes longer. Remove from oven, let cool for 5 minutes, sprinkle with remaining parsley, and serve.
