# Fried Chicken Sandwich

## Ingredients

- ~1 lb. boneless, skinless chicken breast
- 1 cup dill pickle juice
- 1 1/2 cups of milk, divided into 1 cup and 1/2 cup
- 1 3/4 cup peanut or canola oil for frying
- 1 large egg
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 Tbsp. powdered sugar
- 1 tsp. salt
- 1/2 tsp. ground black pepper

### For a Spicy Chicken Sandwich

- 1/2 tsp. paprika
- 1 Tbsp. cayenne powder

## Instructions

- Butterfly the chicken breast. Then using the flat side of a meat tenderizer, pound the chicken until ~1/2 inch thick all around.
- Cut the chicken into 4 equally sized pieces.
- In a large shallow baking dish, combine chicken, pickle juice, and 1/2 cup of milk. Marinate for 30-60 minutes, and then drain well.
- In a large cast-iron skillet, heat the oil to 350&deg;F.
- Set up your dredging station using 2 shallow baking dishes. In the first whisk together 1 cup of milk and 1 large egg. And in the second combine the flour, powdered sugar, salt, and pepper.
- To coat the chicken, first dip the chicken into the milk and egg mixture and then drain the excess. Then dredge the chicken in the flour mixture and set aside for 2-3 minutes. After 2-3 minutes, dredge the chicken once more in the flour mixure and set aside.
- Fry each piece of chicken in the skillet for 2-3 minutes on each side until golden brown. Remove from skillet and drain excess oil from chicken.
- Serve chicken on a hamburger bun that has been lightly toasted with butter. Place 2-3 pickles on the heel of the bun, followed by the chicken, and then place the crown of the bun on top.
