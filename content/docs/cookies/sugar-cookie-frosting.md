# Sugar Cookie Frosting

## Ingredients

- 1 cup unsalted butter softened to cool room temp
- 3 cups powdered sugar
- 1 Tbsp. half and half or milk* plus more as needed
- 1 3/4 tsp. pure vanilla extract
- 1/8 tsp. salt

## Equipment Needed

- KitchenAid mixer

## Instructions

- Beat butter and half of the powdered sugar until well-combined (starting out the mixer low and increasing to medium-high). Slowly add the remaining powdered sugar (while beating), followed by vanilla extract, salt, and milk. Continue to add more milk, a little bit at a time, until you get a creamy spreadable frosting. If desired, you can add food coloring at this point.
- Turn the mixer to medium-high and beat well. Depending on how thick you want the frosting, you can easily adjust the consistency by adding more powdered sugar (to thicken) or more milk (to thin).
