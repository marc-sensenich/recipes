# Steamed Boiled Eggs

## Ingredients

- (Optional) 1 tray of ice cubes
- 6 large eggs

## Equipment Needed

- Large pot
- Steamer insert

## Instructions

- If serving eggs cold, add 1 tray of ice cubes to a large bowl and fill with water.
- Add 1 inch of water to a large pot. Place steamer insert inside, cover, and bring to a boil over high heat. Add eggs to steamer basket, cover, and continue cooking, 7 minutes for soft-boiled eggs or 14 minutes for hard-boiled.
- Serve immediately if serving hot. If serving cold, immediately place eggs in bowl of ice water and allow to cool for at least 15 minutes before peeling.
- To peel, first gently tap hard-boiled eggs all over to thoroughly crack the shell, then remove shell under a thin stream of running water. (The water helps get under the shell and lift it off the egg.)
