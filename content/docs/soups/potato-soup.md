# Potato Soup

## Ingredients

- 6 cups of peeled and diced Russett potates (around 6 medium potatoes. Diced into cubes about 3/4 inch)
- 1 1/2 cups chopped yellow onion (1 medium onion)
- 1 1/4 cups peeled and diced carrots (3 medium or 15 baby)
- 1 cup diced celery (4 stalks)
- 29 oz low-sodium chicken broth
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 1/3 cup butter
- 1/3 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 1/2 cups milk
- 1/2 cup sour cream

## Instructions

- Combine diced potatoes, carrots, celery and onions with chicken broth in a large stockpot and season with salt and pepper to taste.
- Cover pot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat (it will take about 10 minutes to reach a boil), once it reaches a boil reduce heat to medium and continue to cook about 15 - 20 minutes longer until potatoes are very soft when pierced with a fork.
- Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan melt butter over medium heat, add flour slowly while stirring. Once incorporated, cook for 1 minute while stirring with a wooden spoon constantly. While stirring, slowly add milk and cook, stirring constantly until mixture begins lightly bubble and thicken.
- Once potatoes are soft add thickened milk mixture to potato soup mixture and stir (potatoes should start breaking down into soup, if not cook a few minutes longer). Add sour cream and mix well.

## Notes

- Since the sauce will thicken while resting, you may add milk or water when heating it up.
