# Salted Caramel Stuffed Double Chocolate Cookies

## Ingredients

- 1 cup flour
- 2/3 cup cocoa powder
- 1/2 tsp. baking soda
- 1/2 tsp. salt
- 10 Tbsp. unsalted butter softened
- 3/4 cup brown sugar
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 1 egg at room temperature
- 2 tsp. vanilla extract
- 1 1/4 cups semi sweet chocolate chips
- 18 Rolo candies, unwrapped
- 1 Tbsp. coarse sea salt OR sea salt flakes

## Equipment Needed

- 1/2 tsp. measuring spoon
- 1 tsp. measuring spoon
- 1 Tbsp. measuring spoon
- 1/4 cup measuring cup
- 1/3 cup measuring cup
- 1/2 cup measuring cup
- KitchenAid mixer
- Medium mixing bowl
- Baking sheet(s)

## Instructions

- In a medium bowl whisk together flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. In a large bowl beat together butter, brown sugar, and sugar until light and fluffy (2-3 minutes). Mix in egg and vanilla until blended. 
- Gradually mix in dry ingredients on low speed until just incorporated, don't over mix. Stir in the chocolate chips by hand. (I reserve 1/4 cup for adding at the end) Cover TIGHTLY and chill for 2 hours or overnight. 
- Preheat oven to 350&deg;F and take the dough out of the fridge while the oven is preheating. 
- Roll 2-3 tablespoons of cookie dough into a ball. Break the ball in half and place one half on a baking sheet. Press a Rolo into the center of the cookie dough, top with remaining half of the cookie dough ball and press down on top of the Rolo to cover it completely. Press a few chocolate chips into the top. Repeat with remaining dough and Rolos, placing cookies about 3 inches apart on a baking sheet.  
- Bake for 10-12 minutes until the tops of the cookies are just set. Sprinkle immediately with sea salt to taste, then allow to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack to cool completely. 
- Serve at room temperature for chewy caramel OR for melty caramel, pop a cookie in the microwave for 8-10 seconds (this is for my microwave, you might need to test with yours to find how many seconds yields a melted caramel center). Store in airtight container.
