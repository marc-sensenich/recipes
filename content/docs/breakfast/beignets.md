# Beignets

## Ingredients

- 1/4 tsp. dry yeast
- 2 Tbsp. warm water; 105&deg;F
- 2 Tbsp. granulated sugar
- 1 Tbsp. vegetable shortening
- 1/4 tsp. salt
- 1/4 cup heavy cream
- 1/2 egg
- 2 cups (278 grams) all-purpose flour
- 1/4 cup boiling water
- Vegetable oil for frying
- Confectioner's sugar for dusting

## Instructions

- Sprinkle yeast over warm water in a small bowl, stirring to dissolve. Let stand for 5 minutes.
- Combine sugar, shortening, salt, heavy cream, egg, flour and boiling water in a large bowl; stir in yeast mixture. With the dough hook attachment of an electric mixer on medium speed, mix the dough just until combined and smooth. Let dough rest for 30 minutes.
- Roll to 1/4-inch thickness and cut individual beignets into 2 1/2 to 3-inch squares. Cover with a towel and let dough rise until doubled in size in a warm, draft-free area, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
- Using caution, heat 3 inches of vegetable oil to 350Â°F in a deep, heavy pot over medium-high heat. Fry beignets until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes, turning as soon as they brown on one side. Remove with tongs and place on paper towels to drain. Dust warm beignets with powdered sugar and serve immediately.
