# Slow Cooker French Dip Sandwiches

## Ingredients

- 2 1/2 cups low-sodium beef broth
- 1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce
- 1 1/2 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce
- 1 1/2 tsp honey
- 3 lbs chuck roast
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 1 1/2 Tbsp olive oil
- 1 sprig fresh rosemary
- 1 sprig fresh thyme (use a big sprig with several stems)
- 1 large yellow onion, sliced
- 6 cloves garlic, minced (2 Tbsp)
- 6 Crusty hoagie buns (smaller ones) or 2 crusty baguettes cut into thirds
- 3 Tbsp butter
- 6 deli slices provolone or swiss cheese halved

## Equipment Needed

- 6 qt. slow cooker
- 2 cup measuring cup
- 1 Tbsp. measuring spoon
- 1 tsp measuring spoon

## Instructions

- In a bowl (or large liquid measuring cup used to measure broth), whisk together broth, soy sauce, Worcestershire and honey, set aside. 
- Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Dab both sides of roast dry with paper towels, season just lightly with salt and a fair amount of pepper.
- Sear roast in pot until browned on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer roast to a 5 to 7 quart slow cooker, while leaving oil in pot.
- Add onion to pot and saute 3 minutes, add garlic and saute 30 seconds longer. 
- Remove pot from heat, pour beef broth mixture into pot and scrape any browned bits from the bottom. Pour mixture into slow cooker over roast. 
- Submerge rosemary and thyme spring into broth on sides of roast. Cover and cook on low 8 hours.
- Remove roast from slow cooker and transfer to a cutting board, while leaving behind onions and herbs. Shred roast with two forks while removing excess fat.
- If needed season broth and beef with a little salt, if you find it a little too salty for your liking add in a little water to broth mixture.
- Pour broth mixture in slow cooker through a fine mesh sieve into a bowl and discard mixture in sieve.
- Return roast to now empty slow cooker, toss with 1/3 cup of the strained broth mixture.
- For buns, heat oven to 350 degrees (or a countertop toaster oven works great here if you have one). Cut buns through the center, place buns cut side up on a rimmed baking sheet.
- Spread butter on each side then toast in preheated oven about 7 - 8 minutes, add cheese to one of of each bun and toast until melted, about 2 minutes longer. 
- Layer beef over rolls and top with remaining half. Serve warm with remaining broth for dipping.
