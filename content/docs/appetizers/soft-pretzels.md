# Soft Pretzels

## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 cups water, warm (~110&deg;F)
- 1 Tbsp. salt
- 1 Tbsp. sugar
- 1 packet active dry yeast
- 4 cups flour
- 2 1/2 Tbsp. butter, melted
- 10 cups water
- 1/3 cup baking soda
- 1 egg yolk beaten with 1 Tbsp. of water
- coarse salt

## Instructions

- In a bowl mix water, salt, and sugar until combined. Add yeast, and let rest 5 minutes until yeast starts to foam.
- Add flour and melted butter to the bowl. Then mix in a Kitchenaid using the dough hook on speed 2 until a dough ball forms and then an additional 5 minutes on speed 4 - 6 after the dough ball forms.
- Remove the dough ball from the bowl, clean the bowl, and lightly coat the interior of the bowl with oil.
- Place the dough ball back into the bowl, cover, and leave in a warm place for 1 hour.
- Preheat oven to 450&deg;F.
- Put water and baking soda in a large pot of water and bring to a rolling boil.
- Cut dough into 8 equal pieces and roll them out into thin ropes, twisting the two ends to form a pretzel shape.
- Boil each pretzel for 30 seconds per side.
- Transfer pretzels to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, brush with egg wash, and then sprinkle with coarse salt. Bake for 15 minutes, spinning the pan halfway through, until golden brown.
