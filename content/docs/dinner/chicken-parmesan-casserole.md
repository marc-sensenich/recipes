- 3 cups (12 ounces) shredded mozzarella
- 1 cup plain panko breadcrumbs
- 1 tsp. kosher salt
- 1 cup grated Parmesan
- 2 cloves garlic, minced

## Instructions

- Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat.
- Add the fettucine to the boiling water and cook until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of the pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta. Set aside.
- Meanwhile, combine the chicken and 2 cups of the mozzarella in a medium bowl. Combine the panko, Parmesan, garlic, oregano, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of black pepper in a separate medium bowl. Pour in the melted butter and mix until well combined.
