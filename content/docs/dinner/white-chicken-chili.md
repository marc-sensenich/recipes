# White Chicken Chili

## Ingredients

- 1 tbsp. neutral oil
- 1 medium yellow onion, chopped
- 1 jalapeño, seeded, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 1 tsp. dried oregano
- 1 tsp. ground cumin
- 3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into thirds
- 5 c. low-sodium chicken broth
- 2 (4.5-oz.) cans green chiles
- Kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 2 (15-oz.) cans white beans, drained, rinsed
- 1 1/2 c. frozen corn
- 1/2 c. sour cream
- 1 avocado, thinly sliced, for serving
- 1/4 c. chopped fresh cilantro, for serving
- 1/4 c. crushed tortilla chips, for serving
- 1/4 c. shredded Monterey Jack, for serving

## Instructions

- In a large pot over medium heat, heat oil. Add onion and jalapeño and cook, stirring, until softened, about 8 minutes. Add garlic, oregano, and cumin and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add chicken, broth, and chiles; season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, until chicken is tender and cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate and shred with 2 forks. 
- Add beans to pot and bring to a simmer. Cook, smashing about one-quarter of beans with a wooden spoon, until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. Add corn and shredded chicken and cook, stirring, until heated through, about 1 minute more. Remove from heat and stir in sour cream.
- Ladle chili into bowls. Top with avocado, cilantro, chips, and cheese.
