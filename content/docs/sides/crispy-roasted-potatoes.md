# Crispy Roasted Potatoes

## Ingredients

- 1 Tbsp. kosher salt
- 1/4 tsp. baking soda
- 2 pounds of peeled russet potatoes cut into quarters, sixths, or eighths, depending on size
- 2.5 Tbsp. of extra-virgin olive oil
- 3 medium cloves of garlic, minced
- Additional kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

## Directions

- Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat to 450&deg;F (400&deg;F in convection oven)
- Bring 2 quarts of water to a boil over high heat
- Add kosher salt, baking soda, and potatoes to water and stir.
- Bring water back to a boil and then reduce to a simmer. Cook the potatoes until a knife meets little resistance when inserted into a potato chunk. ~10 minutes.
- While the potatoes are boiling, combine olive oil, garlic, and a few grinds of black pepper in a small sauce pan and heat over medium heat. Stir pan constantly until garlic just begins to turn golden. ~3 minutes
- Strain oil through a fine-mesh strainer over a large bowl. Set garlic mixture aside and reserve separately.
- After potatoes have been cooked, drain the water and rest them in the pot for ~30 seconds. Transfer to the bowl with infused oil and season to taste with salt and pepper. Toss the potatoes in the bowl to coat with oil, shaking the bowl roughly until a thick layer of mashed potatoâ€“like paste has built up on the potato chunks.
- Transfer potatoes to a large rimmed baking sheet and separate them, spreading them out evenly. Transfer to oven and roast, without moving, for 20 minutes. Using a thin, flexible metal spatula to release any stuck potatoes, shake pan and turn potatoes. Continue roasting until potatoes are deep brown and crisp all over, turning and shaking them a few times during cooking, 30 to 40 minutes longer.
- Transfer potatoes to a large bowl and add garlic mixture. Toss to coat and season with more salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.
