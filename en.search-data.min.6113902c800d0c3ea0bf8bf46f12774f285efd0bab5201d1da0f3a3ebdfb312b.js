Bring water back to a boil and then reduce to a simmer. Cook the potatoes until a knife meets little resistance when inserted into a potato chunk. ~10 minutes. While the potatoes are boiling, combine olive oil, garlic, and a few grinds of black pepper in a small sauce pan and heat over medium heat. Stir pan constantly until garlic just begins to turn golden. ~3 minutes Strain oil through a fine-mesh strainer over a large bowl. Set garlic mixture aside and reserve separately. After potatoes have been cooked, drain the water and rest them in the pot for ~30 seconds. Transfer to the bowl with infused oil and season to taste with salt and pepper. Toss the potatoes in the bowl to coat with oil, shaking the bowl roughly until a thick layer of mashed potato–like paste has built up on the potato chunks. Transfer potatoes to a large rimmed baking sheet and separate them, spreading them out evenly. Transfer to oven and roast, without moving, for 20 minutes. Using a thin, flexible metal spatula to release any stuck potatoes, shake pan and turn potatoes. Continue roasting until potatoes are deep brown and crisp all over, turning and shaking them a few times during cooking, 30 to 40 minutes longer. Transfer potatoes to a large bowl and add garlic mixture. Toss to coat and season with more salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.
