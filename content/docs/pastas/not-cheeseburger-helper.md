## Ingredients

- 8 oz medium pasta shells
- 1 Tbsp. olive oil
- 1 lb. ground beef
- 1/2 medium sweet onion, diced

- 2 Tbps. all-purpose flour
- 2 cups beef stock
- 15 ounces tomato sauce
- 3/4 cup heavy cream

## Instructions

- In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook pasta until it is al dente according to package instructions; drain well.
- Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add ground beef and cook until browned, about 3-5 minutes, making sure to crumble the beef as it cooks; drain excess fat. Set aside.
