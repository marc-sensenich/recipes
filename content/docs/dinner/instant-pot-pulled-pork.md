- 2 tsp. garlic powder
- 2 tsp. onion powder
- 1 tsp. salt
- 1 tsp. pepper
- 1/2 tsp. cumin
- 1/4 tsp. cayenne
- 3 lbs. boneless pork roast, cut into 3-4 inch cubes
- 2 Tbsp. olive oil
- 1/3 cup apple cider vinegar
- 2 cups barbecue sauce, divided into 1 cup portions

## Instructions

- In a small bowl mix together the brown sugar, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper, cumin, and cayenne.
- Season the cubed pork with the spice mixture and set aside for 30-60 minutes.
- In a medium bowl whisk together the apple cider vinegar, 1 cup of the barbecue sauce, and 1 cup of the broth.
- Turn your instant pot to the saute setting. Add the olive oil and allow it to get hot.
- Add half of the cubed pork to the hot oil and saute for 5 minutes, turning to brown on all sides. Remove the browned pork to a plate and repeat with the remaining half of the cubed pork.

- Add all of the meat along with the barbecue sauce mixture to the instant pot.
- Close the lid and set to sealing.
- Cook on manual high pressure for 40 minutes. Once the cooking time is up, allow the pressure to release naturally for 10 minutes, then do a quick release.
